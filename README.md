# Handwritten-Multi-Digit-Recognition-System

Handwritten recognition digits involve input characters recognized by a system. Simple
artificial neural networks (ANN) have input, output, and hidden layers, while CNNs have a similar
architecture.

Objective of the Project
Handwritten digit recognition uses Convolutional Neural Network, PyTorch library, and
MNIST dataset for accurate identification of imperfect human digits.

Proposed system:
The task is to automatically detect and identify digit images from a database, predicting the type of
the digit. The project aims to train the system using an algorithm to recognize patterns in natural
lighting conditions, using handwritten digits as input. The study aims to assess the technical
feasibility and requirements of the system, ensuring it doesn&#39;t have high demands on available
resources. Additionally, the study aims to assess user acceptance of the system, ensuring efficient
training and not feeling threatened by it. The goal is to ensure the system is accepted as a necessity
rather than a threat.
